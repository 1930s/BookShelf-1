    <h1>Mage - Sufficient Reason</h1>
    <p>A play by post Mage campaign using Cortex Plus.</p>
    <h2>Principle of Sufficient Reason</h2>
    <p>The Principle of Sufficient Reason states “everything must have a cause or reason.”</p>
    <p>The name of this campaign comes from the unstated corollary. “All causes can be found and understood by the human mind given sufficient reason.”</p>
    <p>The question of whether this corollary holds for all of reality, or not, is intended to be a foundational flavor of the campaign. Not a theme, not necessarily a question to answer, but perhaps, an ever present background color.</p>
